# Time-Forecasting
A comprehensive project for time forecasting, specifically predicting the average concentration of particulate matter (pm2.5) based on various environmental features. The project utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The dataset consists of multivariate time series data, including environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, and more. The preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing numerical features, and creating overlapping windows for training. The RNN model is trained on these windows, and the predictions are used to fill missing values in the test dataset. The project also includes data exploration and visualization to understand patterns and trends, showcasing a holistic approach to time forecasting with machine learning techniques.
